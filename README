"byzanz is awesome. i love byzanz. to me it represents pragmatic utility over 
 idealistic artistry"
   -- Mike Hearn

Byzanz is a simple tool to record a running X desktop to an animated GIF file.
It is implemented as a GNOME applet. A command line tool for testing purposes 
is also available.

The most current code is available in GNOME CVS in the byzanz module. It can 
be obtained via the following command:
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co byzanz
