0.0.4
=====
 Features:
 - record the mouse cursor, too
 - revamp the applet, so it mirrors what I want more closely
 - add "record window" option
 - store preferences in GConf

0.0.3
=====
 Features:
 - save with gnome-vfs. Solves an icky bug if the place you save to and /tmp 
   aren't on the same partition, too.
 
0.0.2
=====
 Features:
 - Add file caching if too much happens on screen. This allows recording almost
   everything without losing frames.
 - More work to make the applet UI not block.
 - Set unchanged pixels to transparent. This should imrpvoe the compression 
   algorithm and reduce file sizes somewhat.
 Bugfixes:
 - Make it actually work on little endian systems (no more red)
 - Composite extension no longer required. So it should work on all desktops
   from this millenium
 - And as always: Lots of small bugs

0.0.1
=====
